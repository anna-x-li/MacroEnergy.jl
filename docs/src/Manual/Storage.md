## Overview

`Storage` components store commodities over time, allowing for intertemporal energy management and system flexibility. They are one of the four primary components in Macro, alongside `Nodes`, `Edges`, and `Transformations`. They are sub-types of the `Vertex` type.

Each `Storage` can only handle flows of one Commodity so they are usually described with reference to that Commodity, e.g. as `Storage{Electricity}`, `Storage{Hydrogen}`, or `Storage{Heat}`. The general description is a `Storage{T}`, where `T` can be any Commodity or sub-Commodity.

### Storage in Assets

`Storage{T}` components are incorporated into Assets, representing the ability of those Assets to store and release Commodities over time. This is particularly important for modeling :

- **Battery Storage**: Electricity storage with charging and discharging capabilities
- **Pumped Hydro**: Large-scale electricity storage using water reservoirs
- **Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)**: Mechanical energy storage systems
- **Hydrogen Storage**: Chemical energy storage for fuel cells and industrial processes
- **Heat Storage**: Thermal energy storage for district heating systems

#### Battery Storage Asset

A battery storage Asset can be modeled as a `Storage{Electricity}` component connected to the other Electricity components through charging and discharging `Edges`. The `Storage` component tracks the state of charge of the system, including losses, while the `Edges` handle the power flows in and out of the battery, each potentially with different efficiencies and capacity limits.

#### Hydrogen Storage Asset

A hydrogen storage Asset is a more complex Asset, as it requires `Electricity` flows to run the pumps and compressors necessary to charge and discharge the `Storage{Hydrogen}`.  This is achieved by connecting the `Storage{Hydrogen}` to `Electricity` and `Hydrogen` flows via `Transformation` components that convert between the two commodities. The `Storage{Hydrogen}` component itself manages the state of charge, losses, and capacity limits for hydrogen storage.

#### Long Duration Storage

Many Macro models make use of representative periods to reduce the computational burden of modeling long time horizons. Under their ordinary balance Constraints, the state of charge of `Storage` components will be cyclic across each representative period, i.e. there will be zero net change in the state of charge. This ensures that the System does not have access to "free" mass or energy by preventing situations where the initial state of charge is greater than zero and the final state of charge is allowed to be zero.

While single period cycles are fine for storage which usually discharge within those periods, for example grid-scale Li-ion batteries with one week representative periods, they are not suitable for long duration storage systems that may discharge over multiple representative periods, such as seasonal storage systems. `LongDurationStorage` components are used to represent storage systems that operate across these representative periods, allowing for seasonal energy storage and inter-period coordination. The state of charge of `LongDurationStorage` components is tracked across the representative periods, ensuring that the energy balance is maintained over the entire modeling horizon.

### Storage Outside of Assets

`Storage` components can be used outside of Assets but there is no standard inputs file to do so currently. Most Users will be better served by using `Storage` components within Assets, as this allows for more complex interactions and configurations. However, it is possible to define `Storages` directly in the Julia script you use to build and solve your model. Please feel free to reach out to the developemnt team via a GitHub issue if you have a use case for this.

### Key Concepts

- **Single Commodity Storage**: Each Storage component handles one Commodity type
- **Temporal Energy Management**: Storage enables shifting energy demand and supply across time
- **State of Charge Tracking**: Storage track their time-dependent state of charge
- **Capacity Limits**: Unlike Nodes and Transformations, Storage have capacity limits on the energy and mass they can hold. They do not have charge and discharge limits. Those are handled by the Edges that connect to the Storage.
- **Capacity Investment**: Storage capacity can be fixed or expandable through investment
- **Loss Modeling**: Storage losses are typically modelled as a percentage of the energy or mass stored, impacting the state of charge over time
- **Cyclic Operation**: Storage state loops across modeling periods to ensure conservation of energy and mass
- **Long Duration Storage**: Storage can be configured to track state of charge across multiple representative periods, enabling seasonal storage within Systems using representative periods

## Storage Fields

`Storage` components have the following fields. When running a model, the fields are set by the input files. When creating an Asset, the defaults below can be altered using the `@storage_data` macro. The internal fields are used by Macro and are not intended to be set by users in most circumstances.

!!! note "Units in Macro"
    In the tables below, we have assumed that the Storage component compoent in question is storing energy, such as electricity or heat. Therefore the unit of storage is MWh. Please swap these for tonnes or other units as appropriate for your use case. We have also assumed that your System is using hour-long time steps. You can use any set of units as long as they are consistent across your operations and investment inputs.

## Types

### Type Hierarchy

`Storage` types follow a hierarchical structure rooted in the abstract `AbstractVertex` type:

```julia
AbstractVertex
├── Node{T}
├── AbstractStorage{T}
│   ├── Storage{T}
│   └── LongDurationStorage{T}
└── Transformation{T}
```

Where `T` is a Commodity type parameter that specifies which commodity the Storage handles.

### AbstractStorage{T}

Abstract supertype for all storage types, parameterized by commodity type `T`. Provides common functionality for:

- Unique identification (`id`)
- Time-based data management (`timedata`)
- Balance equation handling (`balance_data`)
- Constraint management (`constraints`)
- Operational expressions (`operation_expr`)
- Storage-specific operations (charging, discharging, capacity management)

### Storage{T}

Standard storage implementation for short-term storage that operates within representative periods.

### LongDurationStorage{T}

Extended storage implementation for long-term storage that operates across multiple representative periods.

## Examples

### Battery Storage

Battery Assets are modeled as a `Storage{Electricity}` component with charging and discharging `Edge{Electricity}`.

#### Battery Asset, Standard JSON Input Format

As Assets with two `Edges` with capacity, the standard JSON inputs for Battery Assets are more complex to ensure Macro can parse similar fields for the charging and discharging `Edges`. As shown below, these Assets make greater use of prefixes to differentiate the `Edge` and `Storage` fields.

```json
{
    "type": "Battery",
    "global_data": {
        
    },
    "instance_data": [
        {
            "id": "battery_boston",
            "location": "boston",

#### Battery Asset, Advanced JSON Input Format

Using the advanced input format makes it easier to understand the structure of the Battery. This format still makes use of well-chosen defaults to reduce the number of fields which must be specified for each `Edge`.

#### Battery Asset, Mixed JSON Input Format

Some users may find it more straightforward to use some elements of the advanced format with the standard format. This works very well with JSON input files but can make CSV inputs difficult to read.

```json

### Hydrogen Storage

Hydrogen storage Assets use the `GasStorage` Asset, which consists of a sequence of `Edges` and `Transforms` which allow a `Storage{Hydrogen}` to be charged and discharged, with the equipment powered by `Electricity`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    H((H2 Node))
    E((Electricity Node))
    subgraph GasStorage
        T1{{Charging Transformation}}
        S[H2 Storage]
        T2{{Discharging Transformation}}
        T1 --H2 Charge--> S
        S --H2 Discharge--> T2
    end
    H --H2 Charge--> T1
    E --Charge Power--> T1
    E --Discharge Power--> T2
    T2 --H2 Discharge--> H
```

Constructing this Asset requires internal and external `Edges`. Under our formulation, we have set the internal charge and discharge `Edges` to have capacity. The external `Edges` do not have capacities but their flows are limited by that of the internal `Edges` and the stoichiometric balances of the `Transformations`. We have also merged the two `Transformations` in the figure above and instead added a second balance constraint.

```julia
struct GasStorage{T} <: AbstractAsset
    id::AssetId
    pump_transform::Transformation
    gas_storage::AbstractStorage{<:T}
    charge_edge::Edge{<:T}
    discharge_edge::Edge{<:T}
    external_charge_edge::Edge{<:T}
    external_discharge_edge::Edge{<:T}
    charge_elec_edge::Edge{<:Electricity}
    discharge_elec_edge::Edge{<:Electricity}
end
```

The following code snippets from the `GasStorage` `make()` function show part of how this Asset is implemented. We recommend reading the [guide on constructing Assets](@ref "Creating a New Asset") for more details on how to create Assets in Macro.

```julia
function make(asset_type::Type{GasStorage}, data::AbstractDict{Symbol,Any}, system::System)

    long_duration = get(storage_data, :long_duration, false)

    # We will then create a Storage or LongDurationStorage component
    gas_storage = StorageType(
